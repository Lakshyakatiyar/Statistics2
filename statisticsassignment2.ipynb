    "Measures of dispersion, including range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to quantify the spread or variability of data points within a dataset. They provide insights into how closely or widely data points are distributed around the measures of central tendency (such as the mean or median). Let's explore each measure of dispersion and provide an example:\n",

    "Consider the heights (in centimeters) of a group of students: [165, 168, 170, 172, 175, 178, 185].\n",

    "Range = 185 - 165 = 20 cm\n",
    "In this example, the range indicates that the heights vary by 20 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance:\n",
    "The variance measures the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. It provides a more precise measure of dispersion than the range and considers the entire dataset.\n",

    "Variance ≈ 7.336\n",
    "Standard Deviation:\n",
